Server side routing - load and flash feature. Typical way sites were created for a long time. 
You go to the page you create a network req to the server, and you load in everything. html, js, script tags,  css, page. This is mostly done with the `<a>` tag.

Client side routing- you're not seeing a flash-- first time page loads one time, creates empty div and react takes over. and then load/updates in component used at a time. It is alot faster. This is mostly done with the `<component>` tag
